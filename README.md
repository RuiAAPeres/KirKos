KirKos, Focus on the most important
======


KirKos is an application I did in less than 24 hours, as a challenge. You can read more about it [here](http://codeplease.wordpress.com/2013/11/02/kirkos-app-development-under-24h) coding standards will be served as the guide for this application.


### Why sharing it?

Why not? The application is for free. The code base is less than 1000 lines. I think on the long run, is more helpful to have it here,  where people can see, experiment and learn than to be "closed" on a private repository.

### What now?


Well, that's up to you. If you would like to see some feature on KirKos you are more than welcome to make a pull request. After reviwing it I will merge it. If it's a considerable contribution, I will take care of pushing to the AppStore, along with the name of the contributor on the comments. If it's a minor one, I will hold it, until I have enough to justify pushing to the App Store.
